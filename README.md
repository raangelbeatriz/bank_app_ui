# Bank App UI
## ‚ú® About
Project made to practice the development of a UI.

To make this I‚Äôve searched a Bank UI on dribbble and tried to reproduce the layout of three different screens. While searching for the perfect UI for this exercise I had one requirement, the design should have at least one component I have never made before. The challenge here was to make a nice animation between the credit cards and also make the bottom nav bar with a FAB button which I was able to achieve.
